## Hey

My name is JoÃ£o Costa. I write code.

I have a [website](https://joaocosta.dev) and a [wiki](https://wiki.joaocosta.dev). You can also find me on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/JoaoCostaIFG).

## The latest from my blog

[Yank to clipboard in fish shell's vi mode](https://joaocosta.dev/blog/17)  
> I don't really use/like vim's killring, so I usually just send all yanks (copies) to the system's clipboard (and paste from it as well). Vi mode in fish shell does not support using the system clipboard, so I wrote a small config for that.
